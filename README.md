# Project Name: lance-voxel-space-node

# License: CC0

Created by: Lightnet

# Information: 
  Just a prototype idea plan testing. Multiplayer online Nodejs Server Prototype voxel and 3D models Spaceship Game.

# Building and running server nodejs:

```
 npm install

```
This will install packages from packages.json script command.

```
 npm start

```
This will start server from packages.json script command.

Notes:
 * It depend on the packages are out date tend to break setup and other things for testing.
 * Refresh page tends to crash the server nodejs if code poor or place incorrect script file.
 * This project is just prototype and has many place holder files for testing.

# Idea Designs:
 * Think of working decentralized peer to peer server
 * But required some main site for access or some form.
 * Zoning/stream mapping system got to build differently.
 * Custom ship design
 * Part design
 * Work shop
 * Script part and ship controls system.
 * Multiplayer builds tests.
